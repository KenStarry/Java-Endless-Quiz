## Question 1 - Two Sum

#### Problem
Given an array of integers and a target number/value, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target value.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use
the same element twice.

#### Sample

```Java
    int[] nums = {2, 7, 11, 15};
    int target = 9;
```

#### Logic
Since `nums[0]` + `nums[1]` = 2 + 7 = `9`, return `[0, 1]`
